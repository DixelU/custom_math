# custom_matrix_types

This is repository for often-used matrix classes. I began to lose the track of versions of these classes, and decided to upload them here

As far as i am aware, both classes requre at least `c++14` (`c++11` support will be added if needed)

`sq_matrix` is constexpr friendly :)
