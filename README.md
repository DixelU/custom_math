# custom_math

This is repository for often-used math classes. I began to lose the track of versions of these classes, and decided to upload them here

As far as i am aware, most classes requre at least `c++14` (`c++11` support will be added if needed)

`sq_matrix`, `long_uint` are constexpr friendly :)
